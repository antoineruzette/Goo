Goo
=======
    
**Goo is an open-source Python library to simulate cells, tissues and embryos in Blender.**

Goo was designed as a platform to model collections of growing, self-replicating, autonomous, and interacting agents, enabling the exploration of tissue organization.
It connects together cellular biomechanics, molecular diffusion in the extracellular environment and gene regulatory networks at the cell-level. 

Users can takes advantage of Blender's rendering engines to render simulations in their preferred format, lighting, background and so much more. 

Goo is hosted on Github at https://github.com/smegason/Goo.
