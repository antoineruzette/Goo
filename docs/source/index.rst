Goo
=======
    
**Goo is an open-source Python library to simulate cells, tissues and embryos in Blender.**

It allows for the simulation of a collection of growing, self-replicating, autonomous and interacting agents in order to simulate biological tissues. 
Goo currently supports mechanical interactions of cells by adapting and extending the physics engine built into Blender, 
but will later support cell-cell communication and biocircuits including gene regulatory networks and signalling pathways. 

Users can takes advantage of Blender's rendering engines to render simulations in their preferred format, lighting, background and so much more. 

Goo is hosted on Github at https://github.com/smegason/Goo.
